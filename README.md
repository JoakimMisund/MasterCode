# MasterCode
Code developed during work on master thesis. Hopefully available for some
time after I have finished.


# Roadmap
Each subsection describes a directory.

## cc_module
Contains the TCP CC module code.

## iproute2-4.13.0
The whole iproute2 toolset with changes required to load the modified RED-Qdisc.

## modified_red
The code for the modified RED-Qdisc.

## kernel
Contain kernel patch for paced chirping and instructions on how to
compile and install it. This takes some time and I do not guarantee that
it works for you, but it should.
